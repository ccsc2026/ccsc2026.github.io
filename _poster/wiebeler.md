title: "Molecular Dynamics and Computational Spectroscopy for Systems in Soft Condensed Phase"
authors: 'C. Wiebeler'
abstract: [
"Molecular dynamics is a wide-spread simulation technique, which (i) we have employed to elucidate photophysical processes based on potentials from electronic structure calculations [1] and (ii) can be used to obtain structural insights into biological macromolecules like proteins [2] and DNA [3] using classical force fields. Complementary to this, computational molecular spectroscopy allows to establish structure-property relationships. For example, our calculations helped to assign chemical shifts and hyperfine couplings to atoms of chromophores [4]. We have also combined both in the framework of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations to understand the molecular origin of the difference in optical absorption between the photoproduct (Pg) and dark state (Pr) of the photoreceptor protein Slr1393 [5]. Currently, we are working on unraveling the mechanisms leading to thermally activated delayed fluorescence in donor-acceptor cyanoarenes [6] and on the parameterization of metal ions, which is a prerequisite for classical MD simulations."]
