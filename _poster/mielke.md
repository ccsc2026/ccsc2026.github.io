title: "RL-guided steering of molecular dynamics via target molecular states"
authors: 'A. Mielke, E. Tapavicza'
abstract: [
"This study presents a benchmark analysis of relaxed scans for three light-driven molecular nanomotors. We compare the performance of Linear Response Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (LR-TDDFT) and Multi-Reference Spin-Flip (MRSF)-TDDFT against a benchmark provided by CASSCF/CASPT2 calculations."]
