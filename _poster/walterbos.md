title: "(U) Mapping the chemical landscape of Halide Double Perovskites"
authors: 'L. Walterbos, A. McEwan, R. Shinde, J. George, L. Leppert'
abstract: [
"Halide Double Perovskites (HDPs) are quarternary materials with chemical formula A2BB'X6, which have recently been regaining scientific attention because they show beneficial properties for photovoltaic, X-ray detection, sensing, photocatalysis, and spintronic application.<br><br>
However, with over 40.000 potential HDP compositions, much of the available landscape remains underexplored. For this, we have generated a database of spin-polarized, hybrid functional (HSE06) DFT electronic structure data, combined with a chemical bonding analysis using LOBSTER (www.cohp.de). This was done for all HDPs with Cesium on the A-site and that are predicted to be stable by Bartel's tolerance factor[1], resulting in a database of quantum-chemical data on >2700 HDP compositions.
<br><br>
The database features some interesting findings, e.g., 134 predicted half-metals and some interesting correlations between the chemical bonding analysis and electronic features of interest. Furthermore, dimensionality reduction (UMAP) is used to visualize the chemical landscape and highlight underlying trends."]
