title: "ORCA6: Next-Generation Software for Real-World Application"
authors: 'C. Plett, A. Dittmer'
abstract: [
ORCA is a versatile ab-initio quantum chemistry software package for electronic structure calculations, spectroscopy, and molecular property prediction. 
We present an overview of recent ORCA developments with emphasis on performance, scalability, and practical applications for large-scale compound space exploration.
<br><br>
Recent releases introduce substantial performance improvements, including optimized parallel efficiency, improved memory management, and enhanced tools for high-throughput calculations.
ORCA’s methodological capabilities have been extended across electronic structure model types, molecular properties, and multi-scale approaches, enabling accurate and efficient simulations
for systems of increasing size and complexity. Advances in spectroscopic methods further support reliable simulations of electronic, vibrational, and magnetic spectra.
<br><br>
We highlight application-driven developments such as improved solvation modeling with explicit solvent treatments, containerized ORCA deployments via Docker, 
integration with GOAT for efficient conformer search, and a brief overview of the OPI as a streamlined interface for ORCA workflows.
