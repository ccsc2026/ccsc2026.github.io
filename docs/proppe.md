abstract: [
"Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) play a key role in transforming carbon dioxide from a waste product into a valuable resource. Data-driven approaches are increasingly important in this field, as they enable more efficient exploration of materials, processes, and reaction pathways. In this contribution, we will outline how concepts and tools from data chemistry can accelerate CCU research, with a focus on the machine learning-assisted design of reaction partners for carbon dioxide."]
