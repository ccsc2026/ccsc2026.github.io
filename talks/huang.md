title: 'Approaching Exactness in Mean-Field Theory through Non-local Fragment-density-based Quantum Machine Learning'
authors: 'B. Huang'
abstract: [Due to the outstanding trade-off between efficiency and accuracy of density functional theory (DFT), 
its combination with modern quantum mechanics based machine learning (QML) enables the accurate prediction of quantum properties 
of many-electron systems with high efficiency. The general scalability of such machine learning approaches, i.e., predicting electronic 
structure details of large query compounds after training on small reference compounds, is still amiss. More importantly, the ever-growing
quest for exactness in DFT is a mission impossible due to the enigmatic nature of the exchange-correlation potential. To overcome these limitations
we introduce the Density Mediated Generalized Fock matrix machine learning (DMGF) model. DMGF, inspired by the linearity of quantum operators,
essentially builds a linear map from the local density based non-local features to the generalized Fock matrix (from which quantum properties 
can be directly computed) for any electronic system, disregarding the nature of the reference method, i.e., being either Hartree Fock (HF), 
DFT or correlated post-HF. The density and knowledge necessary for the mapping is inferred from the reference data of atom-in-molecule-based 
fragments (also known as AMONs). We present numerical evidence that DMGF simultaneously achieves high efficiency, accuracy, scalability and transferability 
(EAST) for electronic structure details of novel test compounds. Systems studied include molecules of varying size spanning the typical organic chemical 
subspace, polymers, non-covalently interacting systems, as well as a solid. Our findings indicate that DMGF paves the way for computationally feasible, data-driven, 
numerically exact solutions to electronic structure problems for arbitrarily sized system, meanwhile bridging gaps between mean-field and correlated 
methods as well as between molecular and solid-state domains.
