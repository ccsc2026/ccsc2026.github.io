title: 'Unraveling subnanocluster stability and fluxionality with MLIPs'
authors: 'R. Laplaza'
abstract: [
The number of plausible configurations of metallic subnanoclusters (SNCs) increases exponentially with the number of involved atoms.
In catalytic conditions, SNC-based catalysts may also undergo rapid changes due to external potential or magnetic fields, as well as interactions with the support or the adsorbates. 
Thus, the relative stability and fluxionality of SNCs in different conditions is of paramount importance for the realistic modelling of heterogeneous 
catalytic processes and, ultimately, for detailed mechanistic understanding and principled catalyst design.
<br><br>
We introduce MLIP-based approaches that leverage the increasing accuracy and availability of transferable foundation models to automatically deal with these 
challenging global optimization problems towards the realistic modelling of heterogeneous catalytic processes. We are able to thoroughly explore increasingly complex 
potential energy surfaces at unprecedented scales, and find unexpected results in terms of surface coverage, active site availability, and overall configurational complexity.
