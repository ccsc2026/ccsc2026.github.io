title: "Machine Learning Potential Energy Surfaces: Validation, Application and Uncertainty Quantification"
authors: 'M. Meuwly'
abstract: [
"In this talk I will discuss the construction, validation, use and
uncertainty quantification of machine learning-based potential energy
surfaces (PESs). Examples to-be-discussed include reactions relevant
to atmospheric chemistry and combustion. A primary focus is on using
dynamics studies to compute observables that can be compared with
measurements for validating the PESs. Secondly, the use of uncertainty
quantification to further improve such PESs in a targeted fashion will
be discussed."]
